CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely used methodology for data mining 
and data science projects. It provides a structured approach that helps guide the entire data mining process 
from start to finish. CRISP-DM is popular because it is industry-, tool-, and application-neutral, 
making it highly adaptable for various types of data projects. Here are the main phases of CRISP-DM:

1. Business Understanding
Objective: Understand the project requirements and objectives from a business perspective and 
translate this knowledge into a data mining problem definition.
Key Tasks: Define business goals, assess the current situation, create a project plan, and identify potential risks.

2. Data Understanding
Objective: Collect and familiarize yourself with the data to determine its quality, gain insights, and identify any issues.
Key Tasks: Data collection, initial data analysis, data description, and quality checks.

3. Data Preparation
Objective: Prepare the final dataset that will be used in the modeling phase. 
This step often takes a significant amount of time.
Key Tasks: Data cleaning, transformation, integration, and selection of relevant features.

4. Modeling
Objective: Apply various modeling techniques to the data to create predictive models.
Key Tasks: Select modeling techniques, set up test scenarios, build models, and fine-tune parameters.

5. Evaluation
Objective: Assess the models to ensure they meet the business objectives and that no critical business issues were 
overlooked.
Key Tasks: Review model results, validate model quality, and decide whether the models are ready for deployment.

6. Deployment
Objective: Implement the model in a real-world scenario so that it can be used for decision-making.
Key Tasks: Create a deployment plan, document the process, and ensure the model can be monitored and maintained over time.

Summary
CRISP-DM is an iterative process, meaning insights from one stage can lead to revisiting and refining earlier steps. This cycle helps teams adapt their approach to achieve the best possible results.
